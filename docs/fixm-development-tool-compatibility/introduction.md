# FIXM Development Tool Compatibility

Although it is not a requirement for exchange models to be
"compatible" with specific development tools, tool compatibility, generally speaking, is 
critical for stakeholder and industry adoption, making an analysis of
development tool compatibility an important topic.

To this end, a compatibility analysis was run using two approaches:
- Approach #1 used FIXM Core 4.3.0 and FF-ICE Message 1.1.0 schemas for creating REST endpoints
- Approach #2 used FIXM Core 4.3.0 and FF-ICE Message 1.1.0 schemas for creating WSDL endpoints

For each approach, testing involved:
- a variety of technologies (e.g., SOAP, REST, JMS)
- several common development toolsÂ 

The result of this compatibility analysis was the creation of a FIXM
support matrix. The section [Compatibility Analysis Results](fixm-development-tool-compatibility/compatibility-analysis-results.md)
supplies a list of the supported tools and technologies.
