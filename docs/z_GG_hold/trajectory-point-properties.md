# Trajectory Point Properties

Each Trajectory Point in a FIXM four-dimensional trajectory can indicate, via use of Trajectory Point Properties, the events of interest that occur at that particular point. The following table is intended to help clarify what each Trajectory Point Property is for and when each of the property types should be used.

|INITIAL_PREDICTION_POINT|Indicates that the associated trajectory point is the initial point at which a prediction was made.

This point need not be the end of the flight.|1|
|CONSTRAINT_POINT|Indicates that the associated trajectory point is the point of application of a constraint.
