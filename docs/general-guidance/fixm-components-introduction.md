# FIXM Components

This section provides explanations about the main FIXM components.

## Introduction to FIXM

The Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) is an exchange model capturing Flight and Flow information that is globally standardised.

The main FIXM components are FIXM Core, FIXM Applications and FIXM Extensions:

- [FIXM Core](general-guidance/fixm-core) provides globally harmonized flight data structures and may be supplemented by FIXM Extensions defining additional flight data structures exchanged locally or regionally (1) and restricted by FIXM Applications down to relevant subsets of data structures needed for particular data exchanges (2).
- [FIXM Applications](general-guidance/applications) provide messaging related data structures and reuse and restrict relevant subsets of the FIXM Core data structures (2) and FIXM Extension data structures (3).
- [FIXM Extensions](general-guidance/extensions) provide additional flight data structures exchanged locally or regionally and are used to supplement FIXM Core (1) and FIXM Applications (3).
