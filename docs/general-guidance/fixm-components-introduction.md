1. [FIXM Core](general-guidance/fixm-core) may be suppelemented by FIXM Extensions defining additional flight data structures exchanged locally or regionally
2. [FIXM Applications](general-guidance/applications) capture messaging related data elements and reuse and restrict relevant subsets of the FIXM Core data structures.
3. [FIXM Extensions](general-guidance/extensions) may supplement an existing FIXM Application by defining additional messaging data structure exchanged locally or
regionally.
