# Target audience

This chapter provides general guidance for understanding the main FIXM components, outlines general requirements for valid FIXM Core and FIXM extensions usage and describes the general rules (encoding rules, data plausibility rules, rules for absent dataâ€¦) that are always applicable whatever the implementation context. It therefore targets all FIXM implementers.
