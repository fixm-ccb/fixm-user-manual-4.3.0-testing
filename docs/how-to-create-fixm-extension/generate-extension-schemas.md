The details presented here should be equally applicable for FIXM Core v4.3.0 as no fundamental shifts in modeling best practices exist between these two versions.

1. Begin the process by right clicking on your Extension root package
    and selecting “Code Engineering” and then “Generate XML Schema…”.
