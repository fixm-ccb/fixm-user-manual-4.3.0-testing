The details presented here should be equally applicable for FIXM Core v4.3.0 as no fundamental shifts in modeling best practices exist between these two versions.

# Generate the Extension Schemas

When all the desired Extension subcomponents are in place, it is time to
generate the schemas for the Extension. The general steps for generating
schemas from the logical model are outlined in [Generating Schemas from the Logical Model](/how-to-generate-xml-schemas/generating-schemas-from-the-logical-model).

1. Begin the process by right clicking on your Extension root package
    and selecting “Code Engineering” and then “Generate XML Schema…”.

2. Then follow the same steps listed in [Generating Schemas from the Logical Model](/how-to-generate-xml-schemas/generating-schemas-from-the-logical-model) to set up and
    generate your schemas.
