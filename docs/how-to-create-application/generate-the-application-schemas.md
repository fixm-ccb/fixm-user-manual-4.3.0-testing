!> **Note to implementers:** This detailed "How To" section was originally developed using FIXM Core v4.2.0 and uses this version as the foundation for the modeling guidance provided in this section. The details presented here should be equally applicable for FIXM Core v4.3.0 as no fundamental shifts in modeling best practices exist between these two versions.

# Generate the Application Schemas

When the Application is complete, it is time to generate the physical
model. The general steps for generating schemas from the logical model
are outlined in [this section](how-to-create-fixm-extension/introduction).

1. Begin the process by right clicking on your Application package and
    selecting “Code Engineering” and then “Generate XML Schema…”.

    generate your schemas.
